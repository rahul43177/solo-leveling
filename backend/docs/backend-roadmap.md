## Development Order & Dependencies

1. Start with Phase 1:
   - Set up project structure
   - Create database models
   - This forms your foundation

2. Move to Phase 2:
   - Implement authentication
   - Required for all other features
   - Protects your endpoints

3. Core API (Phase 3):
   - Build basic CRUD operations
   - Focus on user, domain, goal management
   - These are your primary features

4. Gamification (Phase 4):
   - Add XP and rank systems
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Builds on core features

5. Advanced Features (Phase 5):
   - Add scheduling and analytics
   - Enhance user experience
   - Optional features

## Getting Started

1. First Task: Project Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] python-multipart alembic python-dotenv

# Create project structure
mkdir -p app/{api,core,db,models,schemas,services,utils}
```

2. Second Task: Database Setup
- Create PostgreSQL database
- Set up SQLAlchemy connection
- Create initial models

3. Third Task: Authentication
- Implement JWT authentication
- Create user model and auth endpoints

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authentication flow testing
- Database operation testing

## API Documentation

- Use FastAPI's automatic Swagger docs
- Document all endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Add authentication requirements

## Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting
- Add input validation
- Secure password handling
- JWT token management
- CORS configuration

## Deployment Preparation

- Environment configuration
- Database migrations
- Error handling
- Logging setup
- Performance optimization
