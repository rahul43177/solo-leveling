# Solo Leveling Goal Tracker App with AI Integration - Comprehensive Development Guide

## Project Overview
I want to build a gamified goal tracking application inspired by the Solo Leveling anime/manga. The core concept is to help users achieve their goals through a gamified experience where they "level up" as they make progress. A crucial component is the AI integration that helps users structure their goals, assess their current level, and create personalized progression paths. I'm starting with a web application first, with plans to expand to mobile (iOS and Android) later.

## Core Features

### User Goal Management
- Users can create goals with brief or detailed descriptions
- Users can set deadlines for their goals
- Multiple goals can be tracked simultaneously
- AI-powered goal structuring and breakdown

### AI-Powered Planning System
- AI converts brief goal descriptions into structured plans
- Assesses user's current skill/knowledge level in a domain (like a React developer's skill level)
- Assigns appropriate "Hunter Rank" (E through S rank) based on assessment
- Creates progression paths with specific tasks to advance ranks
- Adapts plans based on user's available time commitment
- Recommends daily tasks based on progression plan
- Adjusts plans based on user's progress feedback

### Task System
- AI-generated daily tasks based on the structured goal plan
- Users check off completed tasks
- Task completion grants XP
- Missing tasks results in penalties
- Task difficulty adjusted based on user's rank and progress

### Gamification Elements
- XP system for progress tracking
- Level progression based on accumulated XP
- Hunter Rank system (E through S ranks) for skill assessment
- Progress bars for visual feedback
- Penalties for missed tasks to create urgency
- "Boss battles" as milestone challenges between rank advancements

### User Experience
- Dashboard to visualize progress
- Daily task list
- Level/rank display
- Statistics and achievements
- AI insights and recommendations

## AI System Architecture & Design

### 1. Goal Analysis & Structuring System

This system will take a user's brief goal description and transform it into a structured plan.

**Implementation:**
- Create a specialized prompt template for goal analysis
- Use few-shot examples to teach the AI how to structure different types of goals
- Include domain-specific knowledge for popular goal categories (programming, fitness, language learning, etc.)
- Implement a feedback loop where users can refine AI-generated plans

**Example Flow:**
1. User enters: "I want to become proficient in React"
2. AI processes this input and requests additional information:
   - Current experience level with React
   - Specific areas of interest (web apps, mobile, etc.)
   - Available time commitment (hours per day/week)
   - Deadline or timeframe
3. AI generates a structured plan with:
   - Main goal broken into milestones
   - Each milestone broken into specific tasks
   - Estimated completion timeframes
   - Resources/references for each task
   - Success metrics for task completion

### 2. Rank Assessment System

This system evaluates the user's current skill/knowledge level in their goal domain and assigns an appropriate "Hunter Rank" (E through S).

**Implementation:**
- Create a knowledge base of skill assessment criteria for popular domains
- Design structured assessment questionnaires for different domains
- Develop ranking algorithms based on assessment responses
- Store domain-specific knowledge hierarchies for progression paths

**Example for React Developer Assessment:**
1. AI asks specific questions about React knowledge:
   - "Can you explain React's virtual DOM?"
   - "Have you worked with hooks? Which ones?"
   - "What state management solutions have you used?"
   - "Have you built authentication systems in React?"
2. Based on responses, AI assigns a rank:
   - E Rank: Complete beginner (HTML/CSS knowledge only)
   - D Rank: Basic React concepts (components, props, basic hooks)
   - C Rank: Intermediate (Custom hooks, Context API, basic routing)
   - B Rank: Advanced (Complex state management, performance optimization)
   - A Rank: Expert (Advanced patterns, architecture, teaching ability)
   - S Rank: Master (Deep framework understanding, contribution-level knowledge)

### 3. Task Generation System

This system creates daily tasks that align with the user's goal plan, current rank, and available time.

**Implementation:**
- Create templates for different task types (learning, practice, project work, review)
- Develop algorithms for task sequencing based on dependencies
- Implement time-boxing based on user's available hours
- Design adaptive difficulty scaling based on user progress

**Example Task Generation:**
1. For a D-Rank React learner with 2 hours daily:
   - Day 1 Task: "Complete tutorial on useEffect hook (45 min) + Build a simple weather app using the hook (1 hour 15 min)"
   - Task difficulty: Appropriate for D-Rank
   - XP reward: 200 XP
   - Resources: Links to recommended tutorials or documentation

### 4. Progress Tracking & Adaptation System

This system monitors user progress and adapts plans based on performance and feedback.

**Implementation:**
- Design progress tracking metrics (completion rate, speed, accuracy)
- Create feedback collection mechanisms after task completion
- Develop plan adjustment algorithms based on performance data
- Implement milestone assessments for rank advancement

**Example Adaptation:**
1. If user completes tasks faster than expected:
   - Increase task difficulty
   - Add more advanced concepts
   - Accelerate progress toward next rank
2. If user struggles with certain tasks:
   - Provide additional foundational tasks
   - Decrease complexity temporarily
   - Offer alternative learning approaches

### 5. AI Conversation & Coaching System

This system provides conversational guidance and motivational support.

**Implementation:**
- Design a coaching persona with appropriate tone and style
- Create conversation templates for different user situations (struggling, excelling, returning after absence)
- Implement motivation techniques based on user progress patterns
- Develop personalized insights based on performance data

**Example Interactions:**
1. For struggling users:
   - "I've noticed you're finding the Redux tasks challenging. Would you like to try an alternative approach first? Context API might be more approachable before moving to Redux."
2. For returning users:
   - "Welcome back! It's been 5 days since you last completed a task. Let's start with a quick review of React hooks before continuing with your plan."

## AI Implementation Details

### 1. Prompt Engineering

Create specialized prompts for different AI functions:

**Goal Analysis Prompt Template:**
```
You are an AI assistant for a Solo Leveling inspired goal-tracking app. Your task is to analyze the user's goal and create a structured plan.

User Goal: "{userGoal}"
User's Current Level: "{currentLevel}" (if available)
Available Time: {availableTimePerDay} minutes per day

Please create:
1. A structured breakdown of this goal into 3-5 milestones
2. For each milestone, create 3-7 specific, actionable tasks
3. Estimate the time required for each task (in minutes)
4. Assign an appropriate difficulty level (1-10) for each task
5. For the domain of this goal, assess what Hunter Rank (E through S) the user currently has based on their reported knowledge
6. Create a clear progression path showing what they need to achieve to advance to each higher rank

Format your response as a structured JSON object following this schema:
{schema details}
```

**Assessment Prompt Template:**
```
You are an AI assistant for a Solo Leveling inspired goal-tracking app. Your task is to assess the user's current skill level in {domain}.

Based on the following information provided by the user:
{userResponses}

Please:
1. Assess their current knowledge/skill level
2. Assign an appropriate Hunter Rank (E through S)
3. Explain why they received this rank
4. Identify knowledge gaps they need to fill
5. Suggest a progression path to the next rank

Format your response as a structured JSON object following this schema:
{schema details}
```

### 2. AI Response Processing

Implement robust parsing and validation of AI responses:

```typescript
// Example processing function
async function processAIGoalAnalysis(userGoal: string, userInfo: UserInfo): Promise<StructuredPlan> {
  // Prepare the prompt with user information
  const prompt = prepareGoalAnalysisPrompt(userGoal, userInfo);
  
  // Get response from AI service
  const aiResponse = await getAIResponse(prompt);
  
  // Parse and validate the response
  let structuredPlan: StructuredPlan;
  try {
    structuredPlan = JSON.parse(aiResponse);
    // Validate against schema
    validatePlanSchema(structuredPlan);
    
    // Apply business logic to ensure the plan is reasonable
    structuredPlan = adjustPlanTimeEstimates(structuredPlan, userInfo.availableTime);
    structuredPlan = validateDifficultyLevels(structuredPlan);
    
    return structuredPlan;
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle parsing errors or invalid AI responses
    logger.error("Failed to process AI response", error);
    return generateFallbackPlan(userGoal, userInfo);
  }
}
```

### 3. AI Service Integration

Create a flexible AI service layer that can work with different providers:

```typescript
// AI service abstraction
class AIService {
  private provider: AIProvider;
  
  constructor(config: AIConfig) {
    // Initialize based on config (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
    this.provider = this.selectProvider(config);
  }
  
  async getCompletion(prompt: string, options: CompletionOptions): Promise<string> {
    try {
      return await this.provider.getCompletion(prompt, options);
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle API errors, rate limits, etc.
      logger.error("AI provider error", error);
      if (this.hasBackupProvider()) {
        // Fallback to backup provider
        return await this.backupProvider.getCompletion(prompt, options);
      }
      throw new AIServiceError("Failed to get AI completion", error);
    }
  }
  
  // Additional methods for different AI tasks
  async assessUserSkill(domain: string, userResponses: AssessmentResponse[]): Promise<SkillAssessment> {
    const prompt = this.prepareAssessmentPrompt(domain, userResponses);
    const response = await this.getCompletion(prompt, { 
      temperature: 0.3, // Lower temperature for more consistent assessments
      maxTokens: 1000
    });
    return this.parseAssessmentResponse(response);
  }
  
  // More specialized methods...
}
```

### 4. Domain-Specific Knowledge Base

Create structured knowledge bases for popular goal domains:

```typescript
// Example knowledge base for React development
const reactDevelopmentKnowledge = {
  domain: "React Development",
  ranks: [
    {
      name: "E",
      description: "Complete beginner with basic HTML/CSS knowledge",
      skills: [
        "Basic HTML understanding",
        "CSS familiarity",
        "JavaScript fundamentals"
      ],
      assessmentQuestions: [
        "Have you used HTML and CSS before?",
        "Can you explain what JavaScript is?",
        "Have you ever built a website?"
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "D",
      description: "Beginner React developer with basic concepts",
      skills: [
        "React component basics",
        "JSX syntax",
        "Props understanding",
        "Basic hooks (useState)"
      ],
      assessmentQuestions: [
        "Can you explain what a React component is?",
        "Have you used the useState hook?",
        "Can you describe the component lifecycle?"
      ],
      learningPath: [
        {
          topic: "React Fundamentals",
          resources: [
            { type: "tutorial", title: "Intro to React", url: "..." },
            { type: "exercise", title: "Build a simple counter", description: "..." }
          ]
        },
        // More learning paths...
      ]
    },
    // More ranks with progressively advanced skills...
  ]
};
```

### 5. Progress Tracking and Adaptation

Implement logic to track progress and adapt plans:

```typescript
// Example adaptation function
function adaptPlanBasedOnProgress(
  originalPlan: StructuredPlan,
  progressData: UserProgressData
): StructuredPlan {
  const adaptedPlan = { ...originalPlan };
  
  // Check completion rate
  if (progressData.completionRate < 0.6) {
    // User is struggling, adjust difficulty
    adaptedPlan.tasks = adaptedPlan.tasks.map(task => ({
      ...task,
      difficulty: Math.max(1, task.difficulty - 1),
      estimatedTimeMinutes: Math.floor(task.estimatedTimeMinutes * 1.2) // Give more time
    }));
  } else if (progressData.completionRate > 0.9 && progressData.averageTimeRatio < 0.8) {
    // User is finding tasks too easy, increase difficulty
    adaptedPlan.tasks = adaptedPlan.tasks.map(task => ({
      ...task,
      difficulty: Math.min(10, task.difficulty + 1)
    }));
  }
  
  // Check for knowledge gaps
  if (progressData.strugglingAreas.length > 0) {
    // Add remedial tasks for struggling areas
    const remedialTasks = createRemedialTasks(progressData.strugglingAreas);
    adaptedPlan.tasks = [...remedialTasks, ...adaptedPlan.tasks];
  }
  
  return adaptedPlan;
}
```
